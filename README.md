# Creating a boilerplate generator for kelp
If you want to generate boilerplate code, you need to use kelp. If you wanted to create a npm-module you could use `nautus kelp npm`. This would search for a npm package called `nautus-npm`. If this package exists, nautus will download it and use it for boilerplate generation. To create your own generator create a new project using `nautus create` and `nautus kelp kelp`. Now jump into your editor to write some code and see examples. After your done, run `nautus release major` to release your first version to npm. After that you can use `nautus release <major|minor|patch>` to publish it again. After that you can use it by using `nautus kelp my-generator`.
